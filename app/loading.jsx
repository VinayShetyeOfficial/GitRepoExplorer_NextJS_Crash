// In Next.js, the loading.jsx file is a special file with built-in support or
// rendering a loading state during route transitions or data fetching. Here's how it works

const LoadingPage = () => {
  return (
    <div className="loader">
      <div className="spinner"></div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default LoadingPage;
